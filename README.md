# Mandelbrot Set Visualisation

**Author:** Kacper Górski

This is a hybrid program created with x64 assembly and C language used for generating visualisations of the Mandelbrot Set. It employs the SDL2 library for image visualisation. This project was developed as an assignment for the Computer Architecture course at WUT. 🎨🖥️

## 🚀 Features

- Generates stunning visualisations of the Mandelbrot Set. 🌌
- Utilises x64 assembly for efficient Mandelbrot set computations. 💻
- Includes C implementation for additional functionality. 🔧
- Integrates the SDL2 library for smooth image display. 🖼️

## 📚 Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```shell
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Ensure you have the SDL2 library installed. You can install it using your package manager or download it from the official website: [SDL2 Official Website](https://www.libsdl.org/). 📥

3. Compile the program using your preferred compiler. For example, if using GCC, you can compile it using the provided Makefile:
