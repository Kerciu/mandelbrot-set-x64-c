# Mandelbrot Set Visualisation

Author: Kacper GÃ³rski

This is a hybrid program created with x64 assembly and C language used for generating visualisations of the Mandelbrot Set. It employs the SDL2 library for image visualisation. This project was developed as an assignment for the Computer Architecture course at WUT.

## Features

- Generates visualisations of the Mandelbrot Set.
- Utilises x64 assembly for mandelbrot set computations.
- Has C implementation along with it
- Integrates the SDL2 library for image display.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have SDL2 library installed. You can install it using your package manager or download it from the official website: [SDL2 Official Website](https://www.libsdl.org/).
3. Compile the program using your preferred compiler. For example, if using GCC, you can compile it using the provided Makefile:
    ```shell
    make
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```shell
    ./mandelbrot
    ```
